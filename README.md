# Dcs211 Final Project

## The program uses biopython to run BlastN from a python file and map the location of labs studying the top species associated with the sequence.

## Direction:
## Download the fasta and python file and put them in the same folder.
## Run the python file, and use the fasta file as the input to run BlastN.
## Once the code finish running, open the html file found in the same folder as the program to find the interactive map.
