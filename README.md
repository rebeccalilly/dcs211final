# DCS211 Final Project

## The program uses biopython to run BlastN from a python file and map the location of labs studying the top species associated with the sequence.

## Python libraries needed for this program: Bio, Bio.Blast, progress.bar, pandas, os, re, geopy.geocoders, folium

## Directions:
## 1. Download the fasta and python file and put them in the same folder.
## 2. Run the python file, and use the fasta file as the input to run BlastN.
## 3. Once the code finish running, open the html file found in the same folder as the program to find the interactive map.
